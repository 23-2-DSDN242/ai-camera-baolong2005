## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm. The images in this project were taken when I was visiting Staglands Wildlife Reserves. The reason why I chose these images was that I took a lot of effort to take these picture to show how beautiful they are. That why I only masked the animals in the images and I used the algorithm to blur the background and detail the animal
Design process: 
I started off quite shaky and slow. It was confusing for me at the time. I just copied every code was shown during lecture. I was not understand what I have to do for the assignment so I was just testing the code. As soon as I realized what I have to do, everything became much easier. The only problem I had was adding the image into the code. Firstly, the images were in wrong dimesion which is 1980x1080 and after I change it, the images were still not loading at all. I thought that I have to use the original images. Somehow, I was testing with the code and I realized that the format of the original images were jpg. When I coverted every images into the jpg, my problem was gone and I started to find the theme I wanted for my code to make. It was really simple to mask the images in Photoshop. After a several testing I sticked with the pixelized background with the animal created by many short lines to show the detail of the animal.
